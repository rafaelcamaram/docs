<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - Node.js version 19 or higher
  - A docs repository with a `docs.json` file
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run the documentation preview locally.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the CLI">

```bash
npm i -g mint
```

</Step>

<Step title="Preview locally">

Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and run the following command:

```bash
mint dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Custom ports

By default, the preview server uses port 3000. You can customize the port by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run on port 3333, use this command:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## CLI versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version. If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```bash
npm mint update
```

## Validating links

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## Deployment

Changes are automatically deployed when you push to your repository's default branch. If the deployment is successful, you should see confirmation in your deployment platform.

## Code formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
  
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mint` folder (or `~/.mintlify` if it exists). Then run `mint dev` again.
