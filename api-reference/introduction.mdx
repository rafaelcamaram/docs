## Overview

The Fortt React SDK provides components and hooks to integrate Fortt into your React or Next.js application. All backend API communication is handled automatically—you only need to work with the React components and hooks.

## Components

### `<ForttProvider />`

The main provider component that wraps your application and enables Fortt functionality. It automatically handles page view tracking and provides Fortt context to all child components.

#### Props

<ParamField body="projectId" type="string" required>
  Your unique Fortt project identifier. This is required to connect your
  application to your Fortt project. **Getting your projectId**: To start your
  trial and receive your `projectId`, contact
  [rafael@fortt.sh](mailto:rafael@fortt.sh). You'll receive your project
  identifier after starting your trial.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="children" type="React.ReactNode" required>
  The child components that will have access to the Fortt context. Typically,
  this is your entire application or a portion that needs protection.
</ParamField>

#### Example

```tsx
import { ForttProvider } from 'fortt/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <ForttProvider projectId="your-project-id">
      {/* Your app components */}
    </ForttProvider>
  );
}
```

#### Behavior

When `ForttProvider` is mounted, it automatically:

- Initializes device fingerprinting
- Creates or retrieves visitor and session identifiers
- Sends verification requests on page load
- Manages all API communication in the background

All of this happens silently with zero visual impact on your users.

## Hooks

Additional hooks for protecting specific actions will be available soon. Currently, `ForttProvider` handles all verification automatically through page view tracking.
