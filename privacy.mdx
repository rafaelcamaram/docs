# What Fortt Sees vs What Fortt Collects

Fortt was designed with **radical transparency**:  

you should always know *exactly* what we see and what we store about your requests.

This page shows:

- The raw data Fortt can see when your backend forwards a `/verify` request

- The minimal subset of data we actually store

- Why each piece is necessary

- Privacy guarantees

---

# 1. What Fortt *Sees* From a Request

When your server forwards a request to Fortt via:

```
POST /api/fortt → https://api.fortt.sh/verify
```

Fortt can *see* the same metadata any backend normally sees about a request.

Here is an example of the **full context** we can observe:

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "path": "/verify",
  "ip": "2804:1b3:6149:8807:6814:6f37:1df9:935b",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)...",
  "acceptLanguage": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
  "headers": {
    "host": "yourapp.com",
    "referer": "https://yourapp.com/login"
  },
  "body": {
    "url": "https://yourapp.com/login",
    "referrer": "https://yourapp.com",
    "clientInfo": {
      "screen": { "w": 1440, "h": 900 },
      "timezone": "America/Sao_Paulo",
      "platform": "MacIntel"
    }
  }
}
```

**But this does NOT mean we store all of this.**

Fortt intentionally drops or ignores anything that could be sensitive or unnecessary.

---

# 2. What Fortt *Actually Stores*

We only store the **minimal fields required** for bot detection, fraud scoring, and network intelligence.

Here is exactly what we persist:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-23T16:34:59.000Z",
  "ip": "2804:1b3:6149:8807:6814:6f37:1df9:935b",
  "asn": 16735,
  "country": "BR",
  "path": "/verify",
  "method": "POST",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)...",
  "visitorId": "8c2b81ac4a6c4f1fb3e95a6019b0ad5e",
  "deviceFingerprint": {
    "platform": "MacIntel",
    "deviceMemory": 8,
    "timezone": "America/Sao_Paulo"
  },
  "signalBreakdown": {
    "ip.reputation": 0.904,
    "ua.bot": 0.485,
    "velocity.check": 0.623,
    "device.fingerprint": 0.700,
    "replay.detection": -0.500
  },
  "finalScore": 0.577,
  "riskBand": "LOW"
}
```

# 3. Why We Store These Fields

| Field                   | Why we store it                                                   | Sensitive?                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **IP**                  | Needed to detect VPNs, datacenters, bad ASNs and velocity attacks | IPs are not personal data by GDPR when used this way |
| **ASN**                 | Strong indicator of bot activity (datacenters, proxies, scrapers) | ❌ Not sensitive                                      |
| **Country**             | Helps detect impossible travels / geo anomalies                   | ❌ Not sensitive                                      |
| **User-Agent**          | Detect headless browsers / automation tools                       | ❌ Not sensitive                                      |
| **visitorId (hashed)**  | Identify continuity from same device                              | ✔ anonymized                                         |
| **Fingerprint signals** | Detect spoofed environments or rotated devices                    | ✔ not reversible                                     |
| **Signal breakdown**    | Transparency + debugging + accuracy tuning                        | ❌ not personal                                       |
| **Score + bands**       | Determine bot likelihood                                          | ❌ not personal                                       |
| **Timestamp**           | Traffic analysis, velocity, replay scanning                       | ❌ not personal                                       |

We **never** store request bodies, form fields, emails, names, or anything tied to your user's identity.

# 4. What Fortt *Never* Stores

To be absolutely clear:

We **do not** store:

* Personal data (name, email, phone, CPF, address)

* Account information

* Payment information

* Business logic parameters

* Form data from your website

* Cookies or session tokens

* Authentication secrets

* Internal identifiers (userId, orderId, etc.)

Fortt has **no visibility** into your application's internal world.

# 5. Side-by-Side Comparison

## What We See

(Raw request context your backend forwards)

```json
{
  "url": "https://yourapp.com/login",
  "referrer": "https://yourapp.com",
  "userAgent": "...",
  "screen": { "w": 1440, "h": 900 },
  "timezone": "America/Sao_Paulo",
  "platform": "MacIntel",
  "ip": "2804:1b3:6149:...:935b",
  "headers": { "...": "..." }
}
```

## What We Save

(Minimal dataset required for fraud detection)

```json
{
  "ip": "2804:1b3:6149:...:935b",
  "asn": 16735,
  "country": "BR",
  "userAgent": "...",
  "visitorId": "8c2b81ac4a6c4f1fb3e95a6019b0ad5e",
  "deviceFingerprint": { "platform": "MacIntel" },
  "signalBreakdown": { "...": "..." },
  "finalScore": 0.577
}
```

Everything else is **discarded immediately**.

# Security Guarantees

### ✔ Data is encrypted at rest

PostgreSQL + Redis with full encryption.

### ✔ Data is encrypted in transit

TLS 1.2+ enforced.

### ✔ No cross-customer correlation

Each project is isolated — your traffic stays yours.

### ✔ Logs have short retention

We automatically purge old entries unless otherwise configured.

### ✔ Fully anonymized device identifiers

`visitorId` is non-PII and cannot be reversed.

# In Summary

You can safely use Fortt knowing:

* We see only what is needed to score risk

* We store an even smaller subset

* None of your user's personal information is collected

* Your application's internal data remains completely private

* Everything is encrypted, isolated, and purged regularly

Fortt is built to protect you — not track your users.
